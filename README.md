# SimplyServers Bugs and Plugin Requests.
Don't want to submit a bug or plugin request via our panel? Github works great too.

<b>For bugs:</b>
Create an issue with a descriptive title and steps to reproduce the bug. Also, tell us what version of MC your running (it helps us a ton).

<b>For plugin requests:</b>
Make sure to tag your issue that it is a plugin request, or the wrong person might see it. Make sure to link us to the JAR or a place to download it. Plugins on SpigotMC or Bukkit are typically approved much faster, while plugins from unknown sources may take some time or not be approved in the first place.
